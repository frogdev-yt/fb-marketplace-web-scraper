Very hard coded basic but functional web scraper I made to help my friend look for deals on motorcycles
Some gross specific hard coded aspects to get around marketplace bot detection / temporary html tags

Currently programmed to have future support for custom search options and prerequisites (only for vehicles at the moment, but can be easily changed)
Next version (if updated) will have UI to add specific general purpose search options with price prereqs
